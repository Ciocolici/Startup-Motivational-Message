# Startup Motivational Message

This is a tiny experiment of mine, my first script/program written in Python. I use it to show me a random motivational message (written by me, for me) every time I start my computer. Learning to be a programmer can be a huge struggle, so having a tiny message like this everytime I start the computer is really helpful.

*To run it on startup you can either create a Basic Task of the file "Startup_Motivational_Message.pyw" with the Task Scheduler or make a shortcut of the file in your startup folder. Using Task Scheduler you can also set it to be launched whenever you log in, that way it can pop up whenever you start your PC, even from sleep.*
