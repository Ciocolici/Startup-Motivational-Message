# Startup Motivational Message

This is a tiny experiment of mine, my first script/program written in Python. I use it to show me a random motivational message (written by me, for me) every time I start my computer.

*To run it on startup, follow these steps:*

*- create a shorcut of "Startup_Motivational_Message.pyw"*

*- write "shell:startup" in your run*

*- copy the shortcut file in the newly-opened folder*
