# Startup Motivational Message

This is a tiny experiment of mine, my first script/program written in Python. I use it to show me a random motivational message (written by me, for me) every time I start my computer.

*To run it on startup, follow these steps:*

*- create a shorcut of "(...)\Startup Motivational Message\Startup_Motivational_Message.py"*

*- start run with "shell:startup"*

*- copy the shortcut file in that folder*
