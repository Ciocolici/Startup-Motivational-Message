# Startup Motivational Message

This is a small Python script that displays a random motivational message each time the computer starts.  
It was created during my retraining as IT Specialist in Application Development, as an experiment to motivate myself every morning before coding or studying. The messages are written by me, for me.

It uses Python‚Äôs `tkinter` module to create a graphical message box with rotating motivational quotes.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to use

To run it automatically on Windows startup:

1. Create a Basic Task in Windows **Task Scheduler** pointing to `Startup_Motivational_Message.pyw`.
2. OR: Create a shortcut of the `.pyw` file in your **Startup folder**.
3. For auto-launch on login, configure the Task Scheduler to run at login or wake-up.

No terminal will pop up thanks to the `.pyw` extension.

**This was my first Python script ever, written purely out of personal motivation.**
